This is the first post of a series about using SQL, and postgres of course, to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. This started as an exercise to master advanced features of postgres/SQL. When I realized that some solutions were quite elegant, I decided to share them here. I've also setup github discussions in this blog so that you can give a feedback.

# [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
Fibonacci Series! This is a classic problem usually solved with a loop. Ops, we don't have loops in SQL, at least not explictly. More specifically, this loop is a `while` and not a `for` loop. The closest thing I've found is a recursive CTE. As explained in the [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html), recursive CTEs are internally evaluated as an iteration.

This solution use the most basic features of recursive CTEs. Let's not hurry. We have enough complexity to start with. It is easier to explain the syntax of a recursive CTE with an example:
``` sql
with recursive t(n) as (
    values(1) -- initial value of t(n)
  union 
    select n+1 from t -- iteration step
)
select * from t limit 5;
```

|  n |
|----|
|  1 |
|  2 |
|  3 |
|  4 |
|  5 |


The query above generates a incremental sequence starting from 1. It is an infinite sequence so if we do not put a limit the query will never end. The structure of the recursive CTE has two placeholders: the stuff before `union` and the stuff after `union`. They are respectively the *initial content* of the table and the *iteration step* by which the table grows. The rest follows as a standard CTE.
## Generating a Fibonacci table
``` sql
with recursive fibonacci(previous_term, term) as (
    values (1, 1)
  union
    select term                 as previous_term,
           previous_term + term as term
    from   fibonacci
)
select * from fibonacci limit 10;
```

| previous_term | term |
|---------------+------|
|             1 |    1 |
|             1 |    2 |
|             2 |    3 |
|             3 |    5 |
|             5 |    8 |
|             8 |   13 |
|            13 |   21 |
|            21 |   34 |
|            34 |   55 |
|            55 |   89 |

## Final solution
This problem asks all even numbers in the series below a given threshold. Inside the recursive CTE we cut the series with a `where` term and we sum all even terms in the concluding `select` statement.   
``` sql
with recursive fibonacci(previous_term, term) as (
    values (1, 1)
  union
    select term                 as previous_term,
           previous_term + term as term
    from   fibonacci
    where  term < 4*1000*1000
)
select sum(term) from fibonacci where mod(term,2)=0
```
Now that I'm used to the recursive CTE syntax, this solution seems quite elegant to my eyes. Well, maybe I write too much SQL...
