# [Problem 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)
This problem asks for 10001st number prime. As far as I know, there is no trick to get there. We need compute all the numbers in the series. As I've written before, solving Euler project problems using a DB has some advantages. We already have some prime numbers stored from problem 2. In order to get the 10001st item, we just use sql `offset` command.

``` sql
select number from primes limit 1 offset 10000
```
