# [Problem 10](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10)
This problem asks for the sum of all prime numbers below two million. This is another problem that can be expressed with elegance in SQL. Since we already have the prime numbers up to 2 million stored in our table `primes`, the solution is as easy as: 

``` sql
select sum(number) from primes where number < 2*1000*1000
```
